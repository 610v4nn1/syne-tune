# Benchmarking in Syne Tune


Benchmarking refers to the comparison of a range of HPO algorithms on one or more
tuning problems, or *benchmarks*. This tutorial provides an overview of tooling
which facilitates benchmarking of HPO algorithms in Syne Tune. The same tooling
can be used to rapidly create launcher scripts for any HPO experiment, allowing
you to easily switch between local, SageMaker, and simulator back-end. The
tutorial also shows how any number of experiments can be run in parallel, in
order to obtain desired results faster.
